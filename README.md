# ~/bin
My personal bin folder

## Usage
You can either:
* Download specific scripts from here and include them in your own bin folder, or
* Clone the whole folder and add it to your path

## Why?
Because I write many many many little scripts and them lose them

## Contributing
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
For fixes you can submit pull requests I guess.
For new features you can ask but unless I need them I'm unlikely to make them.
