File structure:

Files must come in this order:
1. Shebang
2. `set` command
2. Blank line
3. Documentation
4. Blank line
5. Script

Documentation:

1. Documentation lines must:
   * All start with the comment character, followed by a space (`# ` in bash)
   * Or be in a multiline comment block and indented
2. The documentation is made up of one of more running modes
3. Each running mode starts with a line that shows an example of how it's used, followed by an indented paragraph explaining it
4. In the example line the following special characters have meaning:
   * `<>` indicates a non-literal string
   * `[]` indicates an optional string
   * `(|)` indicates a group of options, of which one of which should be taken
   * `|` can also be used with `[]` to indicate a group of optional options
   * `...` indicates repetition
   This is designed to match the system git uses themselves

examples:
```
